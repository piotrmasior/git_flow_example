# Git flow live example

## How it works

Here is described original idea: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
About git flow itself you can read readme at github: https://github.com/nvie/gitflow there are some useful resources also

## Getting started

I don't like read too much so I created cheat sheet for every day use

If you have got already cloned repository on your machine just:

$ git flow init
